The CSS property `filter: blur()` does not work properly in some versions of Internet Explorer and Edge.  It may not apply the blur effect correctly, or it might cause rendering issues with other elements on the page.  Another potential issue is using a very high value for `filter: drop-shadow()`, which can unexpectedly prevent other elements from rendering correctly, or lead to blurry text that is difficult to read.
